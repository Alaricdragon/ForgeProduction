V1.1.6:
did a temporally fix to the fact this mods hullmods were unable to be put on ships with the 'UNBOARDABLE' tags (such as automated ships)
V1.1.5:
fixed crash on startup when ran without crew replacer. sorry about that.
V1.1.4
added version checker support. (hopefully)
updated to the newest starsector version.
added some crew replacer stuff. but don't worry, you can still play this without crew replacer.

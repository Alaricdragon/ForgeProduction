issues presented in forge production:
1) menu is highly frusterating to alture things in.
    -solution: move menu into 3 stages.
        -outser section: shows each forge 'type'. click to enter second section. enable / disable the interer assembly from this window.
        -middle section lets you enable / disable different types of forged items, as well as a 'bar' for each forged item from this forge (to change the raitio of items forged)
         also shows a list of ships with this model instaled on them. click on one to open inter layer.
        -inner layer lets you inable / disable ships (maybe change this to a list on the second layer?)

2) ship forge menu sucks
    -add in a menu like the in game 'produce a ship' menu for the forge production
    -right now, the forge requires you to 'click' on each forge module you want to forge with? for some reason?
        why? this is not ok.
    -right now, the forge requires basic salvage ships. and only the vanila one.
        -first, make this a option in the options. so you can fucking disable it!
        -second, make it so it allows for every ship with a salvage module. should be fine right? RIGHT?!?
    -right now, it desides on the ships layout for you. 2 options here:
        a: only print basic hulls. no wepons or fighters or hullmods
        b: add a refit screen were you have access to infinite amounts of all your blueprints. so you can build your own built refits (cost added to the ship cost.)


3) the interear of the mod:
    change this into a system that allows for some additional data. for example:
    making this a god dam library. because it has a lot of potential. from there, it should be easy to convert the mod into something that uses that library (that will be installed in this mod.)

4) mod settings:
    add in mod settings stuff like I did for starlords. would be a lot nicer to use because arg.
